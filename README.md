## ABOUT THE GAME

RGB Stacker is a block stacking game where you have to pile the boxes on top of eachother. However, there are some caveats: the part of the moving box that doesn't align with the previous box is cut off from the next moving box, making the game harder and harder. Also, for each point you score the moving box starts going faster and faster!

## GAME INSTRUCTIONS

Press the glowing RGB button to start the game, then just left click inside the canvas to drop the boxes.
